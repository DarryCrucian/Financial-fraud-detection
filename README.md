# Financial-fraud-detection
This project is about building a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions. The dataset used for this project is the PaySim1 dataset, which contains information about over 2 million transactions. The goal of the project is to build a model that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions with a low false positive rate.

The first step in the project is to explore the data and identify any potential features that could be used to identify fraudulent transactions. Some of the features that were identified include the amount of the transaction, the time of the transaction, the type of transaction, and the customer's account information.

Once the features have been identified, the next step is to split the data into a training set and a test set. The training set will be used to train the machine learning model, and the test set will be used to evaluate the model's performance.

There are a number of different machine learning algorithms that can be used to detect fraudulent transactions. Some of the most common algorithms include logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines. In this project, a random forest classifier will be used to build the machine learning model.

The random forest classifier is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. The random forest classifier is a powerful algorithm that can achieve high accuracy in detecting fraudulent transactions.

Once the machine learning model has been trained, it can be used to predict whether new transactions are fraudulent or not. The model's predictions can then be used to flag potential fraudulent transactions for further investigation.

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions with a low false positive rate. The model that is built in this project can be used by financial institutions to protect their customers from fraud.
